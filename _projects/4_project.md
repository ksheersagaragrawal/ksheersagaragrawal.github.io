Welcome into the world of the Double-Acting Pump! In this project, I delve deep into the design, mechanism, and significance of this fascinating mechanical system.

**Double Acting Pump** is a type of reciprocating pump that is designed to produce fluid flow in both directions of its stroke, known as the **push** and **pull** strokes. This type of pump is characterized by its ability to generate pressure during both phases of the stroke, making it highly efficient for **agricultural applications**.
