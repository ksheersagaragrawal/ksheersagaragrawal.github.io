I'm excited to announce my role as a Software Development Intern at Amazon Go. During my time from May to July 2023, under the mentorship of Rohit Sharma, I worked on the Store Monitoring Squad in the Inventory Health Management Team. My focus was on the IhmWatchtowerTools, migrating and optimizing this store monitoring service to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambdas, resulting in significant performance improvements.

Key contributions included:
- Working with Java, TypeScript, Spring Boot, AWS CDK, AWS Cloud Watch, AWS Lambdas, and other Amazon internal tools.
- Reducing Lambda runtime from 45 to 30 seconds, cutting per store costs.
- Implementing EventBridge and Alarms based on AWS Cloud Watch metrics for efficient Lambda triggering and store monitoring.
- Enhancing DevOps efficiency by reworking the Device Teams' code logic, which simplified new device onboarding and improved code modularity.
- Contributing to Amazon's internal platform, Sage, with high-quality documentation and valuable bug solutions.

I have also documented my experience and insights in a blog post, aimed at helping future interns and technology enthusiasts.
