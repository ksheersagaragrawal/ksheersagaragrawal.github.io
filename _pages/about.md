I am a senior undergraduate, pursuing major in Electrical Engineering and minors in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

My broad personal interests extend to Algorithms, Optimisation and Machine Learning. I have a knack for programming with a background as a software intern at AmazonGo. 

I want to pursue Master's with a goal to enhance computer vision systems using cutting-edge algorithms.
