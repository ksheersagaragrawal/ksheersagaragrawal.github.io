I am a senior undergraduate, pursuing major in Electrical Engineering and minors in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

My broad personal interests extend to Optimisation, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. I have a knack for programming with a background as an software intern at [Amazon Go](https://www.pocket-lint.com/what-is-amazon-go-where-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/). During my research projects, I have worked on neural network pruning, motion deblurring using GANs, and photometric stereo.
